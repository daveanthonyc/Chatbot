# Chatbot

This is a Telegram chatbot that is built in Node.js with the Telegraf API in a docker container. It simply takes in a Telegram message and checks if it is a specific attendance form and parses it to produce the total attendance and replies it back to the Telegram chat.

## Installation
- Clone the repository
- Build the Docker Image: 
`docker build -t Docker-Chatbot .`

- Run the Docker Image:
`docker run -d -p 8080:80 image-name`

# Product Development Case Study: Streamlining Group Attendance Calculation with Telegram Chatbot

## Problem Identification:

    * Recognized a pain point: Cumbersome process of calculating group totals, particularly on mobile devices for several teams in a department. Time sensitive reports are required to be submitted but are often late due to dealing with miscalculations or just general slowness with adding the values.
    * Identified need for automation to alleviate time and mental overhead.

## Solution Proposal and Stakeholder Engagement:

    * Simply demonstrated to stakeholderes what the input and output of the Telegram bot would be without coding it. 
    * This was to get feedback on the perceived value of the user experience.

## Development and Implementation:

    * After obtaining stakeholder approval, proceeded with development and created the chatbot to aid with attendnace calculations.
    * Ensured seamless integration and this was done by ensuring the commands are easy to learn.

## Outcome:
    * Successfully deployed Telegram chatbot which received much positive feedback.
    * As a result, it is being used each week and saves much time and the department is recognised as one of the fastest departments to submit their time sensitive reports.
    * Significantly reduced time and mental overhead associated with group total calculation.

## Conclusion:
    * Great success.
